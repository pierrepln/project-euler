Hello world ! I am solving some Project Euler problems on https://projecteuler.net/

The Project Euler policy https://projecteuler.net/about asks to not share solutions publicly.

In order to showcase my experience I will simply create a directory for each problem solved.
Each directory will be named after the corresponding problem.

As I won't share any code publicly, please contact me at pierrepl@ntie.fr if you are interested in seeing my solution.
I will be happy to discuss it with you if your request seems fair enough.

Good luck to you all in this great challenge !

#Multiples of 3 and 5

To request my code email me at pierrepl@ntie.fr
Please include why it is fair to share my code with you.
